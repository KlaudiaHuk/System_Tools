File System Paths

There are two paths to navigate to a filesystem
Absolute Path
Relative Path

An absolute path always begins with a '/'. This indicates that the path starts at the root directory.
An example of an absolute path is
cd/var/log/samba/

A relative path does not begin with a '/'. It identifies a location relative to your current position. An example of relative path is:
cd /var
cd log
cd samba
